# This is an example for your wg0.conf file. Usually, this would be in /etc/wireguard/wg0.conf.
# I recommend using a setup script to setup your wireguard server. I use this one: 
# https://github.com/l-n-s/wireguard-install

# ------------------ Start config file ------------------ #

# <server public key>
[Interface]
Address = 10.9.0.1/24
# or whatever private subnet you use
ListenPort = 56785
# or whatever port you use
PrivateKey = <server private key>
SaveConfig = false
# !! has to be false, or WireGuard will overwrite this config file

# append any default peers you have that you want to load by default
# for example, the tunnel you use to acess the API an go here
# keep in mind the allowedIPs generated by the API only starts at 10,
# so you may put 2-9 here, or a completely different subnet, whatever

# ------------------ End config file ------------------ #
